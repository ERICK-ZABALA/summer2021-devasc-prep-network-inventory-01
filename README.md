This repository provides code and examples as part of a [DevNet Associate Certification Preparation Webinar Series](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/devnet-associate-prep-program-in-one-place). The recording for this webinar, and others, can be found in the [DevNet Associate Prep Program Training Plan](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/learning-plan-detail-standard?ltui__urlRecordId=a1c3i0000007q9cAAA&ltui__urlRedirect=learning-plan-detail-standard&t=1596603514739).

Slides from the webinar and discussions about the topic can be found in this [forum post from the Learning Network](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/question/0D53i00001GCgmSCAT/devnet-associate-prep-automating-a-network-inventory-with-python?t=1623087847018).

### Automating a Network Inventory with Python

> Itâ€™s 3pm on Friday. You are already looking forward to your weekend and bingeing the latest season of your favorite show that just dropped. Your boss shows up and tells you he needs a full network inventory by Monday at 8am. He apologizes for ruining your weekend as he heads out to a concert. Can your newly learned network automation skills save your weekend?

## Using this repository 
If you'd like to explore the solution to the above use case yourself, here is everything you should need to know.  

### Lab/Sandbox Resources 
This example leverages the [Cisco NSO Reservable Sandbox from DevNet](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/43964e62-a13c-4929-bde7-a2f68ad6b27c?diagramType=Topology).  You can reserve this sandbox for use with the [nso_sandbox_devices.xlsx](nso_sandbox_devices.xlsx) inventory spreadsheet.  

The network topology for the Sandbox can be seen with this [network diagram](NSO-Sandbox-Lab-Network-Topology.jpg).

If you have your own lab you'd like to try the network inventory script on, you will need to create your own inventory spreadsheet for your lab.  This use case shoudl support devices running Cisco IOS, IOS XE, IOS XR, NX-OS and ASA. 

### Creating the Python venv 
While other versions of Python will likley work, this use case was tested with Python 3.8.  It leverages [pyATS](https://developer.cisco.com/pyats) for interacting with network devices. 

```
# Create your Virtual Env
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install the entire pyATS set of tools
pip install pyats[full]
# Install just the basics for this exercise
pip install pyats pyats.contrib genie
```

### Creating the pyATS Testbed File 
The pyATS YAML testbed is included with the GitHub repo, but you can create one from the Excel file with this command. 

```
pyats create testbed file \
--path nso_sandbox_devices.xlsx \
--output nso_sandbox_testbed.yaml
```

Some suggested improvements to the created testbed file include: 

* Move credentials from each device to testbed level
* `ASK{}` for Username as well as passwords

These changes are included in the [`improved_nso_sandbox_testbed.yaml`](improved_nso_sandbox_testbed.yaml) file. 

### Running the `network_inventory.py` script 
The [`network_inventory.py`](network_inventory.py) script in the repo should work and be ready to go.  

> Note: The sandbox credentials for devices are `cisco / cisco`

```
./network_inventory.py improved_nso_sandbox_testbed.yaml

And it will create a CSV report that looks like 

```csv

## Following the development process 
If you'd like to see how the script was built, you can look at the commit log on the `network_inventory.py` file, or explore the files in the [`development-steps`](development-steps/) folder.  You'll find numbered files showing how the script was build, step by step, that you can run individually, or use as resources to create your own file.
